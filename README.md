## Quick Start

### Local Development

#### Frontend Setup

Note: if you don't have node installed on your pc, you need to install it to use the package manager via: https://nodejs.org/en/download

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Database Setup
Note: You need docker desktop installed for this to work. You can install it 
via this link: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/

Use the provided docker-compose file to create a local postgres database for testing
```bash
# from root
cd backend\user-api

docker compose up --build -d

```

#### Backend Setup

This project uses the [UV package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer) to manage dependencies.

Installing UV (Windows)

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```
Skip the previous step if you have UV installed

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
uv run fastapi dev
```
